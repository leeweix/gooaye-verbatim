## Run this script
```     
./run.sh      
```

This bash file will execute get_yt_info.py which it make an infinite loop to check the updated YT video of gooaye's channel. The video download and transcription script were made by [wiwikuan](https://github.com/wiwikuan). Please check [yt-tldr](https://github.com/wiwikuan/yt-tldr). Note that 'yt-tldr.sh' was slightly modified by myself to push message to user's line account.
